Data from: Page 53 from the vignette.
The data is in the NBPSeq package which does not work in R after version 3.5.0. 

Samples were collected in three batches, and adjustment for batch effects proves 
to be important. The aim of the analysis therefore is to detect genes differentially
expressed (DE) in response to ΔhrcC challenge, 
while correcting for any differences between the batches.

Pseudomonas syringae is a bacterium often used to study plant reactions to pathogens. 
In this experiment, six-week old Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with the ΔhrcC mutant of
P. syringae, after which total RNA was extracted from leaves. Control plants were inoculated
with a mock pathogen.

Three biological replicates of the experiment were conducted at separate times and using
independently grown plants and bacteria.

The six RNA samples were sequenced one per lane on an Illumina Genome Analyzer. Reads
were aligned and summarized per gene using GENE-counter.
